Welcome to JS Wallet, the web-based secure password safe.

JS Wallet has two components. First, the server-side rails app than
handles user authentication, persistence of the encrypted data, and
sharing of the encrypted data. This is build using Rails 3.10. Second,
the browser-side app that decrypts and allows interaction with the
password collections. This uses AngularJS.

JS Wallet is available to the public (with no guarantees) at
http://wallet.kdpeterson.net, running on Heroku. If you want to run JS
Wallet on your own server, you should be able to do so just as you
would any other Rails app.

Significant omissions: the backend supports sharing of collections,
but there is no mechanism within the app to manage this.
